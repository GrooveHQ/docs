# About the GraphQL schema reference

The reference docs in this section are generated from the Groove GraphQL schema. All calls are validated and executed against the schema. Use these docs to find out what data you can call:

- Allowed operations: queries and mutations.
- Schema-defined types: scalars, objects, enums, interfaces, unions, and input objects.

## Exploring our schema

You can also peruse the types visually with our [Voyager]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link reference/index.md%})

You can also access this same content via the GraphiQL Explorer in the sidebar. Note that you may need to rely on both the docs and the schema validation to successfully call the GraphQL API.

## API Guides

For other information, such as authentication and rate limit details, check out the [api]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guides/index.md%}).
