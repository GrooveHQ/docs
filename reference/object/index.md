# Objects

Objects in GraphQL represent the resources that you can access. Objects can contain a list of fields, which are specifically typed. For example, the `Repository` object has a field called `name`, which is a `String`.

For more information, see [the GraphQL spec](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/#sec-Objects).

Note: this is not a comprehensive list of all accessible Objects. We exclude certain auto-generated ones from this list, i.e.:

- Connections
- Edges
