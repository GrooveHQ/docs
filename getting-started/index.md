# Getting Started

The GraphQL API lets you build apps and other integrations for all of Groove's
products using GraphQL. With the API, you can create apps that offer functionality
like Inbox, Knowledge Base and Chat.

The GraphQL API is version 2 of Groove's API. It is a GraphQL-based alternative to
the REST-based API provided in version 1.

The GraphQL API makes the functionality of Groove available at a single GraphQL
endpoint. The full set of supported types can be found in the [GraphQL API reference]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link graphql-api/reference/index.md%})
