# Connection and Edge Types

This API follows the [Relay GraphQL Server Specification](https://relay.dev/docs/en/graphql-server-specification).

Relay expresses one-to-many relationships with connections. Connections support pagination, filtering and metadata in a robust way.

Connections and Edges are indeed [Objects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link reference/object/index.md%}), but are listed separately here in order to reduce noise in that section.
